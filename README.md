# Exploratory Data Analysis Terrorism

## Overview:
In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to terrorism incidents. The aim was to gain insights into patterns, trends, and relationships within the data to better understand the phenomenon of terrorism.

## Key Steps:
1. **Dataset Description**: I utilized a dataset sourced from [provide source/link]. The dataset contains [describe key attributes such as size, format, variables included, etc.].

2. **Data Cleaning**: Prior to analysis, I cleaned the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring that the data was suitable for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: I employed various EDA techniques, including summary statistics, data visualization, time series analysis, geospatial analysis, and correlation analysis, to explore the dataset and uncover insights.

4. **Feature Engineering**: I performed feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones, extracting meaningful information to enhance the analysis.

5. **Hypothesis Testing**: I formulated hypotheses about the data and tested them using appropriate statistical methods to validate or refute assumptions.

6. **Insights and Conclusions**: I summarized the key findings from the EDA, discussing patterns, trends, and relationships observed in the data. I also provided insights gleaned from the analysis and discussed their implications for understanding terrorism-related phenomena.


## Technologies Used:
